I am an economics PhD student at the [University of Pennsylvania](https://economics.sas.upenn.edu). My primary fields are industrial organisation, market design and public economics. I conduct research on the economics of tech and on markets in developing countries. 

Previously, I have worked on electricity markets at the Energy Policy Institute in the University of Chicago [(EPIC)](https://epic.uchicago.edu/about/). I have a masters in EME from [LSE](https://www.lse.ac.uk/study-at-lse/Graduate/degree-programmes-2022/MSc-Econometrics-and-Mathematical-Economics) and I studied mathematics at the [Indian Institute of Science](http://www.math.iisc.ac.in).
