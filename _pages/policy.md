My research has always had a deliberate focus to inform policy. Towards the end of my undergrad, I interned at [CSTEP](https://cstep.in), which brings frontier technological solutions to solving concrete policy problems. I worked on using AI based tools to help predict the demand for water in hyperfine geographic detail to help governments in southern Indian states direct water supply during the worst of summer.

From 2018-2020 I was very lucky to work with [Prof. Fiona Burlig](https://www.fionaburlig.com) on extremly policy relevant projects. We studied Indian electricity markets and tried to understand understand regulatory blind spots in their market design. We communicated our findings directly to central and state government actors in order to help them envision (i) tariff design for electricty that save poor households from suprising debts, (ii) expanding the supply of electricity which is brought to energy exchanges to keep supply robust during peak seasons. I spent the summer of 2019 in Delhi, exclusively to present our work to relevant stakeholders in the hope of moving the needle on these policies in the near future. 

My own research focuses on questions which have direct policy relevance. I am very keen to partner with policy organisations that bring their domain expertise and effective outreach, so that we can help shape better regulatory policies in tech and developing markets.
