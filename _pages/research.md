  <summary>Abstract</summary>
  How do recommenders change the supply of content creators that is available to consumers? We sample streams from a large music streaming platform and find that niche music has declined in terms of its streams and producers. We explain this through a monopolist platformâ€™s price decisions with heterogeneous creators and consumers. We show that if there are fixed costs incurred by creators, then as the recommender system gets better the platform screens out niche content by lowering their streaming rates. Nevertheless, good recommender systems better match the surviving content and overall effects on consumer surplus is ambiguous. We write down a model of consumer to empirically analyze demand using a random coefficient model. We will estimate this model using recommendations and usage data from a large streaming platform and comment on the role of pricing and recommendation in jointly determining supply.<br>

- Hicks Biased Technical Change and Firm Heterogeneity (with [Ulrich Doraszelski](https://bepp.wharton.upenn.edu/profile/ulrichd/#overview))
  <details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
  We examine the role of labor augmenting technical progress in crafting observed aggregate patterns. We set up a tractable model of a distribution of firms which have heterogeneous labor and capital augmenting technologies. We solve for both static and dynamic models and write down analytical expressions for how various aggregate objects evolve when the distribution of labor productivity shifts, while using computational methods to carry out comparative statics for the derived distributions of labor shares, concentration etc. We find that labor augmenting technical change robustly explains observed patterns of labor share movement, however patterns of concentration are fragile to model specification. <br>

  How do labor regulations determine unemployment and firm dynamics? We examine the importance of firm side frictions in leading to this unemployment with data from the Indian labor market. We have access to a novel historical panel of administrative data on manufacturing firms at a monthly level. Using variation from an exogenous policy shock that raised firing costs and flexible production function estimation techniques, we will identify how the input mix changed in India. We will then structurally model the general equilibrium effects of this tax on employment using a Hopenhayn-Rogerson type framework. <br>

- The Welfare Implications of Government Provided Ground Transport: Evidence from India (with [Advait Aiyer](https://advaitr8.github.io))
  <details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
  How important are low-cost public transport options for consumer welfare? Rural to urban migration, is known to be a powerful force for poverty alleviation, happens mostly on intercity transit and is majorly serviced by public providers. However, the rapid repeal of public options, which is often peddled as a cost saving measure for governments, could significantly hurt low-income consumers. We assemble a comprehensive dataset of intercity transit in an Indian state and will use demand estimation techniques to demonstrate the welfare added by public options. <br>

  Can we solve the pipeline problem using affirmative action policies? I write down a setup with heterogenous agents belonging to advantaged and disadvantaged groups. I show that one-shot affirmative actions are sufficient when signals are equally informative across groups. This cannot be extended in the presence of differential signal structures. Knowing group biases in the ways people are screened in any stage of a pipeline is thus imperative before we can prescribe affirmative action policies. <br>

- Price dispersion, trade and local goods markets: Evidence from India
  <details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
  Do information frictions lead to significant market power? Real world markets are spread out geographically and involve disaggregated exchange between a smaller subset of buyers and sellers in multiple locations.I will study the interaction of information with market infrastructure in jointly
determining the distribution of rents between the players in this exchange. To empirically ground this exercise, I will use data from the Indian agricultural  sector. <br>
